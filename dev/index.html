                <p>Welcome to my Integrated Body Coach world!  I am married to my amazing husband of 30+ years, Russell Burns, and am the mother of 3 incredible adult children who are now starting families of their own.  I have had the privilege of working with these awesome people in starting and running several healthcare companies here over the past 15 years. I have personally struggled a great deal over my lifetime to balance health, work, and family, with my balancing act often coming up lacking.

At one point, my life was completely out of balance from the demands of a 24/7 business. I would have told you that I owned the business, but really the business owned me. That was when I learned first hand what stress, poor food choices, and lack of sleep could do to a body. Among other things, all of that earned me a referral to the hematologist. That got my attention. I began to take a serious look at my lifestyle and all the things that work together to create overall health and wellbeing. It has since been my passion and desire to put all that together and spend my life supporting and coaching others who are caught up in that same whirlwind.

I had the privilege of working with an exceptional Master Trainer for about 4 years who absolutely changed my life.  When we sold our most recent business, I decided to take a year off to get some formal training in fitness, health and life coaching.  I have had lots of practice managing people, solving problems, and weaving the principles of health and wellness into my own life and am excited to now be doing that from a more focused role.  My personal health has been restored to an excellent status by simply following a basic nutritional and fitness plan, sleeping better, and taking ownership of my work. By just changing some lifestyle behaviors and learning to manage my stress more effectively, I never did need to see the hematologist.

We all know that wellness is not just about looking great or performing better than the other guy.  It also doesn't just happen - it takes work, effort and intentionality.  It requires attention on many fronts - nutrition, exercise, stress reduction, grief processing, emotional intelligence, interpersonal skills and relationships, mental and spiritual well being. All these aspects of our being human work together to either build up or tear down our quality of life.

My mission is to come alongside you on your journey and provide structure, guidance and accountability as YOU discover, define and realize YOUR integrated personal best.
